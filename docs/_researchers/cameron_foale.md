Cameron Foale is a lecturer and researcher at Federation University, with an interest in building usable, fair, transparent, and scalable connected eHealth systems. His current research projects consider how statistics, digital signal processing and artificial intelligence can be applied to time-series data, gathered from either non-linear systems or self-reported health data. Dr Foale also works closely with ARAAC members in human-aligned and multiobjective reinforcement learning and artificial intelligence. He has spent significant time in industry, and has a deep understanding of how to bring ideas from conception to production.
