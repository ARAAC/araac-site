Peter Vamplew is an Associate Professor of Information Technology at Federation University (Ballarat), and co-founder/co-leader of ARAAC. Previously he has been Associate Dean (Research) for Science and Technology at Federation University. Since about 2008 he has played a leading role in establishing multi-objective reinforcement learning (MORL) as a sub-field of reinforcement learning, explicitly designed for problems with multiple conflicting objectives (which describes most real-world problems).
More recently he has been studying the role which MORL can play in creating human-aligned artificial intelligence. His contributions in this area are reflected by his appointment as a senior member of the Future of Life Institute’s Existential AI safety Research Community. He has been an associate editor for Neurocomputing journal, and guest editor of special issues of Neurocomputing and JAAMAS on MORL and multi-objective decision-making, and an invited speaker at the Adaptive Learning Agents workshop and the Workshop on Human-aligned Reinforcement Learning for Autonomous Agents and Robots. He is also an experienced supervisor of Masters and PhD research students.
