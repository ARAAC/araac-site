# Australia's leading cross-institutional responsible AI collective, envisioning the future of human-agent interaction

## Growing reliance on Artificial Intelligence brings new technical, ethical, and humanitarian issues to the forefront.

The Australian Responsible Autonomous Agents Collective (ARAAC) are focused on addressing the technical, ethical, and humanitarian challenges posed by the rise of intelligent systems, in particular systems composed of autonomous agents. A cross-institutional collective of AI researchers, our team specialises in Multi-objective Reinforcement Learning, explainability, transparency, and AI safety, building the theory and practice of balancing AI performance and responsibility.

Our mission is to drive innovation while anchoring our discoveries in responsible and ethical practices. We strive to make AI not just advanced but also accountable, ensuring its alignment with human interests.
